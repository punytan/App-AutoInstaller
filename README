DESCRIPTION

    App::AutoInstaller is a convinient script for perlbrew + cpanminus + cpan-outdated.

    I am one of the perlbrew user. perlbrew is awersome but I am disgusted by installing modules what I ALL need in each perl.
    In addition, I think that keeping modules fresh is good thing, I implemented cpan-outdated feature.
